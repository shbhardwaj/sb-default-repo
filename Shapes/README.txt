===============================PROBLEM STATEMENT================================================================
Introduction

You have to write one small program. Your delivered result shall be compilable and runnable.
Furthermore it is important to deliver simple and elegant object oriented code. The idea behind the test
is to give you a chance to show us your idea of the ‘perfect’ solution.
The time to make the code is limited to 4 hours, but that is surely more than enough.
Test 1. Visitor
-Create an Interface or Abstract base Class 'Shape'.
-Implement three concrete Shapes: 'Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle'.
-Apply the visitor pattern to your data model.
-Write an AreaVisitor that computes the area of the shapes.
-Write a main/tests that makes an arbitrary instance of a data model and apply the AreaVisitor.
